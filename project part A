				<h2>The future of Amazon drone deliveries</h2>
				<p>Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) has filed for a patent for beehive-like towers that would serve as multi-level fulfillment centers for its delivery drones to take off and land. The facilities would be built vertically to blend in with high rises in urban areas. Amazon envisions each city would have one.
				The patent application, filed in December 2015 and published on Thursday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, features several drawings of these buildings, such as the beehive, a cylinder-shaped center and one that looks like a UFO</p>

				<h2>Pakistanies foods we Halwa Puri</h2>
				<p>Halwa Puri is a traditional desi breakfast that Lahoris love with all their hearts. The authentic taste of Halwa Puri will always take you back to old Lahore: with the best taste in the city! Zafar Halva Puri definitely takes the lead on this. It’s outdoor street dining (well not exactly dining, but what’s the proper Lahore experience if you don’t SIT on the street and have your food?!) where you are served fresh puris so you can eat them to your fill. Next up is their halwa – halwa is a sweet breakfast dish enjoyed fully by everyone. The pairing of halwa puri is just wonderful for everyone to start off a lazy Sunday with!</p>

				<h2>New York City's best rooftop bars</h2>
				<p>There's something about being far above the hubbub of the Big Apple's streets, especially in the summertime, when humidity levels soar and the concrete feels like it's emanating heat waves.
				"Being on a New York City rooftop gives you this special pleasure of feeling part of the city, inside it, but at a distance," says Ray Chung, director of design at The Johnson Studio, the firm behind the rooftop lounge at The Wit Hotel in Chicago, among other projects."Walking down the streets is one thing, but being able to let your guard down and see the city reduced in size -- all the while still breathing the same air and still hearing the buzz of the city -- it can be intoxicating," says Chung.</p>

				<h2>The best things to do and see in Newport</h2>
				<p> Many of those cliches about postcard-pretty coastal New England towns got their start in the same place: Newport, Rhode Island.The town is best known for being a summer getaway for America's aristocracy during the Gilded Age, with wealthy families like the Vanderbilts, the Dukes and Astors all owning summer homes there (they say "cottage," we say "ginormous mansion") and throwing glamorous parties.Although more of the luxurious estates are museums than homes these days, Newport hasn't lost its seaside charm -- especially in the summer. Here's our guide to the best things to do, eat and explore both indoors and out.</p>

				<h2>Critters Ark Welfare Organization, Rawalpindi</h2>
				<p>Anila said, “There is very little awareness about animals in our country. Here, animals are treated like strange creatures. This is the reason why we and animal rescuers in other cities are trying our best to raise awareness about the rights of animals; that these are living beings made by God for a purpose, without which our ecosystems would not survive”.Anila’s animal shelter is within her own home in Rawalpindi where she cares for and feeds more than a hundred rescued dogs, cats, goats, birds, and a variety of creatures. “It makes my heart happy, especially when people talk to me about it, consult me, and share their concerns about their pets. Sometimes, we help people who cannot afford treatment for their animals,” she remarked. </p>
